# Kasir Kopi SQL Mini Project

Simple SQL practice simulating a coffee shop cashier system.

## Tables
- `products`: List of coffee products
- `transactions`: Transaction header (date)
- `transaction_items`: Detail of each product bought

## What I practiced
- `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `AGGREGATE FUNCTION`
- Filtering by date
- Subquery

## Sample Query Results
- Total sales per day
- Best-selling product
- Average purchase per transaction
